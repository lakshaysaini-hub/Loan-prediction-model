# Loan-prediction-model
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict loan approval decisions. The model is built using Python and various machine learning techniques on Google Colab, with data sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to accurately classify loan applications based on a set of input features.

Key Features:
-Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for modeling, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
-Model Training: Implemented and trained the model using popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
-Evaluation: Used cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance and ensure reliable predictions.

This project showcases the process of building a practical machine learning solution, from data preparation to model deployment.
